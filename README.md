A macro for ImageJ to streamline the process of measuring features of the unconfined electrospinning process. The user is prompted to select a folder that contains a .gif or top-down pictures of the spinning process and will save measurements in a new file based on the selected measurement. All modes measure the selected positions but use different save names.

After selecting the folder, the user will be prompted on whether to use the existing .gif file if present, otherwise a new file will be created.

To set the scale the user can either enter the spinning edge length or manually set the scale

They are then prompted to draw a line along the spinning edge to allow the program to set the scale (if not manual), rotate the image so that the edge is horizontal, and set the zero points.

Finally, the user will select the desired features on each image and click "ok" to save.
